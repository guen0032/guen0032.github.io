                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p><em>Hello! Welcome to my page!</em></p>
                <p> 
                    My name is Charlie, I am 28 years old. 
                    I am originally from the small town of Kingston, Nova Scotia.
                    My family moved to the United Kingdom after my 9<sup>th</sup> birthday.
                    A year later we moved to Winnipeg, where we spent a few years before coming to Ottawa.
                    I enjoy travel, and visiting other countries. 
                    Most recently, I went to Mexico with my partner and his family.
                    We stayed in the Mayan Riviera near Tulum, where I hope to one day visit again.

                    Having worked in both food service and in retail, I am looking to make a change in career paths.
                    I enrolled in the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program to learn a variety of new skills and hopefully one day become my own boss.
                    When I am not doing school work I am constantly listening to music. 
                    My favourite genre is house and tech-house.
                    Lately I have been listening to a lot of Martin Ikin and Hannah Wants.
                    In my spare time I am a hobbyist DJ and also enjoy playing the guitar.
                    During this program I am most looking forward to learning about digital graphics and web development.
