                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p><strong>Hello!</strong></p>
                <p><em>Welcome to my page!</em></p>
                <p> My name is Charlie, I am 28 years old. 
                    I am originally from the small town of Kingston, Nova Scotia.
                    My family moved to the United Kingdom when I was 10.
                    We then moved to Winnipeg, where we spent a few years before coming to Ottawa.
                    I have travelled to many other countries, most recently to Mexico to see the Mayan Riviera.
                    My partner and I had a trip planned for Cuba in 2020 but unfortunately Covid had other plans.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Having worked in both food service and in retail, I am looking to make a change in career paths.
                    I enrolled in the <b>Interactive Media Design</b> program to learn a variety of new skills.
