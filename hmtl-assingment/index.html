                <p><strong>Hello!</strong></p>
                <p><em>Welcome to my page!</em></p>
                <P> My name is Charlie, I am 28 years old. 
                    I am originally from the small town of Kingston, Nova Scotia.
                    My family moved to the United Kingdom when I was 10.
                    We then moved to Winnipeg where we spent a few years before coming to Ottawa.

                </P>
